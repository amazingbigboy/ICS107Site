<h2>Welcome to Changing Styles!</h2>
<p>We have all the information you need about changing the styles of your website. It's fast, it's easy and a lot of fun.
Cascading style sheets can help make your website look fresh and appealing. Changing the look of your site has never been easier. Change the styles and the whole site is updated.</p>
<h2>Cascading Effect</h2>
<p>If similar items are formatted with CSS within external CSS sheet, web pages and users styles, there is a cascading effect. The user defined styles take precedence over both webpage defined styles which take precedence over external CSS sheet styles.</p>
<p>If an external style sheet specifies that the background color for a page is pink and the individual webpage specifies the color is yellow, then the color will appear yellow. If a user has their own style sheet which they use to view all pages which specifies the background color to be blue, then the page will appear blue to that user.</p>
<p>In addition, styles for specific codes have a precedence. Codes for the whole page are superseded by the codes specified for a specific layout structures. If you want a style to affect all similar items throughout the document, instead of within a particular layout structure, change the style for the code and not within a layout structure.</p>
<p>Styles can also be applied with the span command, but it's best to avoid the span code in websites.</p>
