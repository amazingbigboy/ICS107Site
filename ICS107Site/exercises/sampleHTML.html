<h2>Other text elements</h2>
<p>Most text is entered in paragraphs. Text automatically wraps down to the next line, but the end of the line doesn't always stay the same. It will change on a web page depending upon the computer system used, web browser used and what the reader's preferred font size is. Web pages do not necessarily look exactly the same from browser to browser.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>	Web design is an art and a science. I think that's what makes it so hard. Most of us don't have the artistic talent to create great Web designs, the science and math skills to develop all the technical elements, and the understanding of interface design and usability that make a Web site easy to use and intuitive to navigate. But you need all those skills to create a great Web site. That's why most of the best Web sites were created by a team of people with many different specialties. - Quote from Janine Warner</p>
